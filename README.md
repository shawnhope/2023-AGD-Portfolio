2023 AGD Portfolio Projects

Initially, I took DGM1600, DGM1660, and DGM1620 in 2017-2018, submitted my class projects to the portfolio review, and did not get accepted; my projects weren't good and I knew I didn't do my best. 

Every year since I've debated whether or not I should attempt my second review or just change majors, but I know I've improved. I continued learning to code and use Unity, and have been steadily working on personal projects for the last four years. 

I want to give it one last go, knowing that I submitted my best work.
